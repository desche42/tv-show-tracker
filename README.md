# Installation

>
>*Commands may change depending on your OS.*


Globally install the package:

```bash
npm i -g tv-show-tracker
```

Program will be installed in your `node/bin` folder. Node folder can be found executing in a terminal:

```
which node
```

In this folder **database**, **downloads** and **config** files are stored.


# Usage

## Adding shows to track

To add a show to track execute in a terminal:

```
tv-show-tracker add
```

and you will be prompted for the show name.

> Note that show name has to be the same as stored in database file.

Selected shos are stored the file `config/local.json`:

```javascript
{
	...
	selectedShows: [
		'doctor who',
		'the magicians',
		'brooklyn nine-nine',
		...
	]
	...
}
```

## Track shows

To track shows (search for and download new episodes), execute in a terminal:

```
tv-show-tracker track

// or simply

tv-show-tracker
```

The first time the program is run, TV Show schedule is crawled from an online web and available tv shows are populated in the database: `database/db.json`. 


And that's it!

## Watch downloaded shows

Shows are downloaded in `data/downloads/` folder inside app folder.
To watch completely downloaded episodes execute:

```
tv-show-tracker watch
```

And you will be prompted to select a show and an episode.

## Backup data

You can backup database and downloads to another directory / external drive:

```
tv-show-tracker backup <destination directory>
```

This command is useful if you want to backup app's state: *downloads* and *database*.

It will not delete files present in destination but not in origin. 

After executing the command, you can manually delete downloaded episodes that you have already watched without loosing any data.

## Further configuration

File `config/default.js` has the default config and config keys descriptions.

You can create a local config file doing (in app installation folder):

```
echo '{}' > config/local.json
```

> Note that if you've added a show with 'tv-show-tracker add', the file will be automatically created.

Although config options are described in `config/default.js`, there is more information in:

- [Search](src/search/README.md)
- [Schedule](src/schedule/README.md)
- [Download](src/download/README.md)

and below.


# Lifecycle

1. **Update calendar**

	Calendar is updated if *config key* `updateCalendar` is set to true and current month is not found in the database.

2. **Start cycle**
	
	In each cylce two things are done simultaneously:

   1. **Search for new torrents**
   	
		 Aired episodes without a torrent are searched. Results are stored
		 into the DB to be downloaded next cycle.
		 Config key `maxSearchAttempts` sets the number of times an episode will be searched for a torrent before considering its dead. Set to 0 to infinite attempts.

   2. **Download available magnets**
   
	 	Episodes marked as not downloaded and have a torrent magnet start downloading (throttled with `simultaneousDownloadLimit` config key).

3. **Start new cycle** 
   
	 If *config key* `reset` is set to true, and there are new episodes to
	 search, new cycle is started.
	 --> if not torrents are found, it will keep searching **forever** (or until `maxSearchAttempts` are reached for all torrents)


# Limitations

This project is ment to automatically download latest episodes of tv shows, so them are expected to be alive (lots of peers). Downloading past episodes is slower
and may cause the app to hang, since it waits for the torrents to download before starting new downloads (see lifecycle).

# TO DO's

- [ ] Tests:

	Ohh tests! I love testing. I really do!!


	Sadly, this project started as:
	
	>Fuck! I missed the last season of The Magicians! And Modern Family! And The flash! And Dr Who! And ... <several more>, why Netflix doesn't have these shows?? (in Spain at least). 
	> 
	> This can never happen again...
	>
	> Anyway lets download them...
	>
	> Ugh! 35 magnets? Let's automate this

	So tests weren't implemented. I needed to watch new shows I didn't have time for tests!
